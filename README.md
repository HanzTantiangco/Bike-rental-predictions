# Bike-rental-predictions

Using a neural network to predict daily bike rental ridership based on historical data. The bike sharing dataset is split into training and validation set. The neural network is first trained on the training set. The validation set is then used to indicate how well the neural network has modelled the data by comparing the prediction of the neural network with the actual number of riders for a given time range.
